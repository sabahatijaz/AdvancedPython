    "1. Lambda Functions\n",
    "Lambda functions are also called anonymous functions in Python. Some people simply refer to them as lambdas. They have the following syntax: lambda arguments: expression. In essence, we use the lambda keyword to signify the declaration of a lambda function. Then we list the arguments, the number of which can be zero or more. After the colon, we list the expression that uses these arguments for any applicable operations.\n",

To accomplish it, we took advantage of the lambda function, in which the x argument refers to each tuple that was to be sorted.

The following code snippet shows you how the hashability of particular objects may affect their qualifications to be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "The biggest advantage of using hashes is instant look-up time (i.e., O(1) time complexity) for fetching an element in the dictionary. Similarly, checking whether a particular item is in the set takes a constant time, too.

    "In creating a python generator, we use a function. But in creating an iterator in python, we use the iter() and next() functions.\n",
    "A generator in python makes use of the ‘yield’ keyword. A python iterator doesn’t.\n",
    "Python generator saves the states of the local variables every time ‘yield’ pauses the loop in python. An iterator does not make use of local variables, all it needs is iterable to iterate on.\n",
    "A generator may have any number of ‘yield’ statements.\n",
    "You can implement your own iterator using a python class; a generator does not need a class in python.\n",
    "To write a python generator, you can either use a Python function or a comprehension. But for an iterator, you must use the iter() and next() functions.\n",
    "Generator in python let us write fast and compact code. This is an advantage over Python iterators. They are also simpler to code than do custom iterator.\n",
    "Python iterator is more memory-efficient."
